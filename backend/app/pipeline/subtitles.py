"""Builds short-form captions as an ASS subtitle file with word-by-word highlighting.

Why ASS instead of SRT
----------------------
SRT carries no styling, so ffmpeg's `subtitles` filter falls back to libass
defaults -- including PlayResY=288. Every FontSize and MarginV then gets scaled
by 1920/288, which is how a MarginV of 120 ended up ~800px off the bottom,
landing captions in the middle of the frame on top of people's faces.

Writing ASS ourselves lets us declare PlayResX/PlayResY as the real 1080x1920
output, so every number below is honest pixels, and lets us emit one event per
word so the active word can be highlighted as it is spoken.
"""

MAX_WORDS_PER_CUE = 3          # keep lines short enough to read in a glance

# Caption sizes are px on the 1080x1920 reference canvas -- the same number the
# editor shows. Bounds keep text readable without swallowing the frame.
# Captions are burned in BEFORE the speed filter runs, so subtitle timings stay
# on the ORIGINAL timeline and the speed change carries them along with the
# picture. Scaling them here as well would double-apply the speed.
