"""Tightening dead air out of a clip.

Raw footage breathes: someone thinks mid-sentence, reaches for a word, waits for
a laugh. On a long-form timeline that reads as natural. In a 30-second short it
reads as a slow edit, and slow edits lose the viewer -- the clip stops feeling
*made* and starts feeling merely *cut out*.

Detection is done from word timestamps rather than audio silence detection. The
transcript already knows exactly when speech stops and starts, so a gap between
one word ending and the next beginning IS the pause -- no second ffmpeg pass, no
threshold tuning against background noise, and no risk of mistaking a quiet
delivery for silence.

Cutting time out means every caption after the cut is now early, so this module
also returns the words with timings remapped onto the shortened timeline. The
two must be produced together or the captions desync.
