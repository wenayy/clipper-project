    `start`/`end` cut a window out of the source instead of copying all of it,

    podcast re-encoded end to end so that someone could scrub a 45-second clip.
    Everything outside the trim window is unreachable in the editor, so encoding
    it bought nothing and cost all of the wait. The window is ~105s, so this is
    roughly a tenth of the work and finishes while the clips are still rendering.

    ffmpeg fills an mp4 progressively and only writes the moov atom at the very

    browser can decode. The editor's readiness check is "does this file exist",
    so anyone who opened the editor during the encode got a lifted loading veil
    over a permanently black, unseekable video. With the swap, the file does not
