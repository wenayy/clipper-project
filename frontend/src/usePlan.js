         The admin bypass (ADMIN_EMAILS) grants every entitlement while leaving
         the plan column at "free", so a plan-string check told admins their
         exports would be watermarked when the server had already decided they
         would not be. Any future comped account has the same shape.

         "Free" therefore means HOLDING NOTHING BEYOND WHAT FREE ITSELF GRANTS,
         which is not the same as holding nothing. Testing for an empty list
         worked only while Free had no capabilities at all, and every free
         account started reporting isFree === false the day it gained caption
         editing. Comparing against the server's own list for the free plan
         keeps this correct however the plans are rearranged next.
